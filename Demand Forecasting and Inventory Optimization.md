## Introduction
Demand Forecasting involves predicting the quantity and pattern of customer orders, which is crucial for businesses to efficiently allocate resources, manage inventory, and plan production. Accurate demand forecasting enables companies to meet customer needs, avoid overstocking or understocking, and optimize their supply chain operations.

Inventory Optimization aims to strike a balance between having sufficient stock to meet demand without carrying excess inventory that ties up capital and storage space. Effective inventory optimization helps businesses reduce carrying costs, improve cash flow, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## üíº Case study 
### Requirement
Using appropriate forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or exponential smoothing for demand forecasting. Then, use the demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels by implementing strategies like reorder points, safety stock, and economic order quantity (EOQ) calculations.

### Application
- Raw Material Procurement: Optimizing inventory of raw materials based on demand forecasts ensures that production processes are not halted due to material shortages.
- Cost Reduction: By aligning production with demand, manufacturers can reduce holding costs and avoid the costs associated with excess inventory.
- Dynamic Inventory Management: E-commerce platforms can use demand forecasting to manage their inventories dynamically, adapting to changing consumer preferences and seasonal trends.

## üìÅ Data set
For the task of Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization, we can start by gathering historical sales data, customer orders, and relevant external factors like seasonality, promotions, and economic trends.

## üîé Analysis

### 1. Import necessary Python libraries and the dataset
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX

data = pd.read_csv("demand_inventory.csv")
print(data.head())
```

### 2. Clean data
```python
data = data.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0'])
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'], format='%Y/%m/%d')
time_series = data.set_index('Date')['Demand']
differenced_series = time_series.diff().dropna()
```
### 3. Visualize the demand and inventory over time
```python
fig_demand = px.line(data, x='Date',y='Demand', title='Demand Over Time')
fig_demand.show()
```

```python
fig_inventory = px.line(data, x='Date', y='Inventory', title='Inventory Over Time')
fig_inventory.show()
```

### 4. Demand Forecasting
```python
# Plot ACF and PACF of differenced time series
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))
plot_acf(differenced_series, ax=axes[0])
plot_pacf(differenced_series, ax=axes[1])
plt.show()
```

The value of p, d, and q will be 1, 1, 1

```python
order = (1, 1, 1)
seasonal_order = (1, 1, 1, 2) #2 because the data contains a time period of 2 months only
model = SARIMAX(time_series, order=order, seasonal_order=seasonal_order)
model_fit = model.fit(disp=False)

future_steps = 10
predictions = model_fit.predict(len(time_series), len(time_series) + future_steps - 1)
predictions = predictions.astype(int)
print(predictions)
```

### 5. Inventory Optimization
```python
# Create date indices for the future predictions
future_dates = pd.date_range(start=time_series.index[-1] + pd.DateOffset(days=1), periods=future_steps, freq='D')

# Create a pandas Series with the predicted values and date indices
forecasted_demand = pd.Series(predictions, index=future_dates)

# Initial inventory level
initial_inventory = 5500

# Lead time (number of days it takes to replenish inventory) 
lead_time = 1 # it's different for every business, 1 is an example

# Service level (probability of not stocking out)
service_level = 0.95 # it's different for every business, 0.95 is an example

# Calculate the optimal order quantity using the Newsvendor formula
z = np.abs(np.percentile(forecasted_demand, 100 * (1 - service_level)))
order_quantity = np.ceil(forecasted_demand.mean() + z).astype(int)

# Calculate the reorder point
reorder_point = forecasted_demand.mean() * lead_time + z

# Calculate the optimal safety stock
safety_stock = reorder_point - forecasted_demand.mean() * lead_time

# Calculate the total cost (holding cost + stockout cost)
holding_cost = 0.1  # it's different for every business, 0.1 is an example
stockout_cost = 10  # # it's different for every business, 10 is an example
total_holding_cost = holding_cost * (initial_inventory + 0.5 * order_quantity)
total_stockout_cost = stockout_cost * np.maximum(0, forecasted_demand.mean() * lead_time - initial_inventory)

# Calculate the total cost
total_cost = total_holding_cost + total_stockout_cost

print("Optimal Order Quantity:", order_quantity)
print("Reorder Point:", reorder_point)
print("Safety Stock:", safety_stock)
print("Total Cost:", total_cost)
```

- Optimal Order Quantity: 236 ‚Äì The optimal order quantity refers to the quantity of a product that should be ordered from suppliers when the inventory level reaches a certain point. In this case, an optimal order quantity of 236 units has been calculated.
- Reorder Point: 235.25 ‚Äì The reorder point is the inventory level at which a new order should be placed to replenish stock before it runs out. In this case, a reorder point of 235.25 units has been calculated, which means that when the inventory reaches or falls below this level, an order should be placed to replenish stock.
- Safety Stock: 114.45 ‚Äì Safety stock is the additional inventory kept on hand to account for uncertainties in demand and supply. It acts as a buffer against unexpected variations in demand or lead time. In this case, a safety stock of 114.45 units has been calculated, which helps ensure that there‚Äôs enough inventory to cover potential fluctuations in demand or lead time.
- Total Cost: 561.80 ‚Äì The total cost represents the combined costs associated with inventory management. In this case, the total cost has been calculated as approximately 561.80 units based on the order quantity, reorder point, safety stock, and associated costs.
